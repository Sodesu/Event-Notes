At Event Notes, accessible from the Microsoft Store, one of our main priorities during the application's development was the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that are collected and recorded by EventNotes and how we use it.

Information We Collect

EventNotes is a reminder application that allows users to set notes for specific dates and times or for the launch of native Windows applications. The application does not collect personal information. All data entered into the application, such as reminder notes and dates, are stored locally on the user's device and are not transmitted to any servers or third parties.

Use of Your Information

The information provided within Event Notes by users is not accessed by the app developer, nor is it shared with any third parties. All data is stored locally on your device for the functionality of the app alone, which entails:

Providing the core features of the application.
To notify you about changes to our application.
To allow you to participate in interactive features of our application when you choose to do so.
To provide customer support.
Log Files

Event Notes follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they use applications. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, device type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

Children's Information

Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. Event Notes does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
